# Enhancing SQL Agent with ChromaDB and LangChain

This notebook upgrades the basic SQL Agent by introducing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities using ChromaDB and LangChain. This allows the agent to search relevant database context (e.g., schema, past queries, documentation) before generating SQL code.

## Key Features

- Integrates **ChromaDB** as a vector store for schema/document indexing
- Uses **LangChain** for orchestration and retrieval pipelines
- Hybrid agent combining LLM + semantic search
- Dynamic retrieval of SQL context to enhance accuracy

## Tools & Frameworks

- LangChain
- ChromaDB
- OpenAI
- FAISS (backend for ChromaDB)
- Vector embeddings (OpenAI or other)

## Workflow

1. Index table schema and sample queries into ChromaDB
2. Receive user query (natural language)
3. Retrieve relevant context using vector similarity
4. Construct LLM prompt with retrieved context
5. Generate SQL output

## Why It Matters

- Reduces hallucinations in SQL generation
- Enables few-shot learning using previous examples
- Paves the way for autonomous agents with memory
