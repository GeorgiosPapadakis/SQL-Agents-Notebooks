# SQL Agent Notebooks 

This repository showcases the development of an LLM-powered SQL Agent capable of translating natural language queries into executable SQL code. The project is built in two modular phases — from core logic prototyping in notebooks to future deployment via a FastAPI app.

## Project Structure

- `SQL_Agent_–_LLM_powered_Natural_Language_to_SQL_System.ipynb`: Core system logic for converting natural language into SQL using an LLM.
- `Enhancing_SQL_Agent_with_ChromaDB_and_LangChain.ipynb`: Extends the agent with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using ChromaDB and LangChain for contextual awareness.

## Future Work

This notebook series will evolve into a production-ready API, deployed with FastAPI and optionally containerized with Docker.
