# SQL Agent â€“ LLM-powered Natural Language to SQL System

This notebook demonstrates the core logic of a lightweight SQL agent capable of translating natural language queries into SQL statements using a Large Language Model (LLM). The system is structured for modularity and ease of transition into a production-grade API.

## Key Components

- Natural language prompt engineering
- SQL database schema context injection
- Query generation via OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` (or other LLMs)
- Error handling and validation mechanisms
- Simple SQLite test database

## Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenAI API
- SQLite
- Pandas
- Prompt engineering patterns

## Use Case

This is ideal for scenarios like:
- Analysts querying databases via chat interfaces
- Auto-reporting tools with natural language commands
- Education & data access democratization

## Highlights

- Includes robust prompt templates
- Early-stage modular agent structure
- Designed with extension to RAG & API in mind
